  ### Short

  Turnover for last month in national currency. 
  
  ### Abbreviation

  Expected to be the full amount, i.e. 1 000 implies 1 thousand in the local currency.

  ### Other formats

  You can also send in the turnover as a range. Say that you know that the turnover is in the span 
  50 000-100 000, then you can serialize that value as 
  `[50000,100000]`.

  If you know that the turnover is above a certain value, say 1 000 000, then that can be serialized as
  `[1000000,null]`

  ### Turnover currency code?

  Note that the currency is specified when issued API key.
