  Number of full time employees.  
  
  ### Other formats

  You can also send in the number of employees as a range. 
  For instance if the company has between 1 and 10 employees, then that can be
  serialized as 
  `[1,10]`.

  If you know that the number of employees is greater than a certain value, say 250, then that can be serialized as
  `[250,null]`
